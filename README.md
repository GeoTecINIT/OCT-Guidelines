# OCT interactive stories 

The OCT interactive stories tool is a webtool to help city stakeholders walk through a story. It provides a full stack of components to create and publish interactive stories. It offers some interactive blocks, like code, charts and maps to add the ability of users to dynamically explore and interact (to certain degree) with the story.

### Demo
A demo of the OCT interactive stories is accessible at [OCT interactive stories](http://lsivirtual.dlsi.uji.es/).
